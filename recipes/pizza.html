        This week on Basics, I'm taking another look at our beloved pizza and showing you how 
        to make great pan pizza at home using a cast iron skillet.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text">Ingredients</h2>
    <h3 class="text"><em>For the pizza dough (makes two 10-inch crusts)</em></h3>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>16 ounces flour, plus more for work surface</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>11 ounces room temperature water</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text"><em>For the tomato sauce</em></h3>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>1 28-ounce can of peeled San Marzano tomatoes (they taste better from the smaller cans)</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>Dried oregano and basil</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text">Method</h2>
    <ol class="text">
        <li>Start by making your pizza dough. Combine flour, kosher salt, and active dry yeast in a big bowl.</li>
        <li>Add room temperature water and mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms and no dry clumps remain.</li>
        <li>Generously oil a medium bowl with olive oil. Put the ball of dough into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 18-24 hours.</li>
        <li>Once rested, turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface. Cut the dough in half, as this will make 2 crusts for the cast iron skillet.</li>
        <li>Oil the skillet with olive oil. Place the dough in the plate and gently coax it to the edges using your fingers.</li>
        <li>Cover the plan with plastic wrap and let rest for at least one hour or until doubled in size. Now is also the time to preheat your oven- turn it on to its max heat settign and put a pizza stone in the oven as well.</li>
        <li>While your dough rises, make tomaot sauce. Combine tomatoes, garlic cloves, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a food processor or large cup for an immersion blender. Pulse a few timings until smooth. Optionally, add a dash of olive oil for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Prepare your other toppings - I love to use prosciutto (or ham for lack thereof) and buratta cheese.</li>
        <li>Now that the dough is ready, top it with saurce edge to edge, then add the shredded mozzarella. Top with your toppings!</li>
        <li>Bake for about 11-12 minutes</li>
        <li>Top with freshly grated parmesan cheese and let rest for at least 5 minutes so you don't burn your mouth. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
