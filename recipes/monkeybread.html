    <p class="text">
        Monkey bread goes by many different names: bubble loaf, sticky bread, pinch-me cake, 
        and countless others. But as Shakespeare once wrote… a monkey bread by any other name 
        would smell as sweet.

    <h2 class="text">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>500 g bread flour</li>
        <li>7 g instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>170 g granulated sugar, divided + more for the pan</li>
        <li>100 g whole milk, warm (~85°F)</li>
        <li>200 g water, warm (~85°F)</li>
        <li>10 g kosher salt</li>
        <li>85 g unsalted butter, cubed + very soft (~75-80°F)</li>
        <li>As needed non-stick spray</li>
        <li>200 g brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text">Method</h2>
    <ol class="text">
        <li>Combine the flour, yeast, and 50 grams of sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer.        </li>
        <li>Evenly combine the dry ingredients using a whisk or fork.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, water, and salt to the bowl. With the mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine the dough on medium-low speed until almost homogeneous.</li>
        <li>Begin adding the butter, one cube at a time, and waiting until each cube is incorporated before adding another one until all of the butter has been added.</li>
        <li>Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough is smooth, elastic, and clears the sides of the bowl, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl and cover it with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Let the dough proof until about doubled in size, about 1-2 hours depending on the warmth of the room.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grease 1 large tube or bundt pan or loaf pan or muffin tin generously with non-stick spray.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the remaining 120 grams of granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a lightly oiled work surface. Divide and shape the dough into even golf-ball-sized portions.*If using a muffin tin, make portions half the size.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough balls in the melted butter and then in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place them into the prepared baking pan(s). </li>
        <li>Loosely cover the pan(s), and allow the dough to proof for another 45 minutes - 1 hour, until puffed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 °F.</li>
        <li>Once risen, remove the plastic wrap from the pan(s). Brush the dough with any remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, turning halfway through, until the dough is cooked through (200-205 °F) and golden brown on top.</li>
        <li>Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes, then flip it onto a serving platter of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
